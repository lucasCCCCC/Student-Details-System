# Student Details System 

A GUI application written in Java using JavaFX following MVC design patterns used to capture student details such as: year of study, student id, module choices

Students are displayed in order of year of study & when right clicking on a student, a context menu appears, giving choices to delete or edit a students details

This was my solution for a university assignment scoring 100/100
